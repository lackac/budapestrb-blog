# budapest.rb blog

This is the repository for the [budapest.rb](http://ruby.meetup.hu) blog. The source of the blog can be found in the [`gh-pages`](/lackac/budapestrb-blog/tree/gh-pages) branch. Look there for further information.

This blog used to be built with Webby, but eventually we migrated to [Jekyll](http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and now the site is generated and served by [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). You can still find the old blog under the [`retired_blog`](/lackac/budapestrb-blog/tree/retired_blog) tag.
